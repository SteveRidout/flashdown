# TODOs

## Essential

- If user has no topics to study, point them to where they can download some online and tell them to copy them to their home directory ~/.flashdown
- Add command line option to show SRS stats
- Timer which updates the home page state after an hour (?), also updates the time in the practice record file if too much time has past

## Nice to have

- Change view model to something that makes it possible to style text and still be able to easily count the number of on screen characters, enabling styling within the cards, horizontal panning animation, and more
- Animation flare:
  - slide cards to reveal
- Show SRS stats somewhere
- Allow quitting session with ESCAPE key
- Allow removing cards (and editing?) - press "x" key after reveal
- Allow pointing to directory: SHOW all files in home page list, grouped by filename, maybe with way to practice all from certain file, or all from across all files
- Allow formatting within card - use bold text
