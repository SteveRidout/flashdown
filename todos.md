- Only use typing mode if previous attempt was successful after an interval of > 5 days
- Better data structure to store all card and practice data after parsing, which can be used by any of the tools (practice, stats, etc...)
- End of session stats
- Store notes.fd and notes.fdr files in a standard location, e.g. ~/.flashdown/notes.fd
- Allow using command line options to override config, e.g. notes.fd file
- Create a starter deck which teaches you how Flashdown works :-)
- Figure out how to package to make it an NPM module
