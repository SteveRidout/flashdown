# TODOs

## Essential

- Change how ~/.flashdown works - look for ALL \*.fd files there, if 1 use that, if > 1 allow user to choose upon starting app OR... instead use ~/.flashdown config file which can point to whichever .fd files you like, which could be on Dropbox for example
  - if pointing to directory: SHOW all files in home page list, grouped by filename, maybe with way to practice all from certain file, or all from across all files
- If user has no topics to study, point them to where they can download some online and tell them to copy them to their home directory ~/.flashdown
- Allow formatting within card - use bold text
- Add command line option to show SRS stats

## Nice to have

- Change view model to something that makes it possible to style text and still be able to easily count the number of on screen characters, enabling styling within the cards, horizontal panning animation, and more
- Animation flare:
  - slide cards to reveal
- Show SRS stats somewhere
- Allow quitting session with ESCAPE key
