# TODOs

- Change how ~/.flashdown works - look for ALL \*.fd files there, if 1 use that, if > 1 allow user to choose upon starting app OR... instead use ~/.flashdown config file which can point to whichever .fd files you like, which could be on Dropbox for example
- If user has no topics to study, point them to where they can download some online and tell them to copy them to their home directory ~/.flashdown
- Figure out how to package to make it an NPM module
