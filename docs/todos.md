# TODOs

## Essential

- Add command line option to show SRS stats
- Timer which updates the home page state after an hour (?), also updates the time in the practice record file if too much time has past
- Better intervals for when you fail to remember a card
- Add random jitter to card intervals so that groups of the same cards don't all turn up at once

## Nice to have

- Change view model to something that makes it possible to style text and still be able to easily count the number of on screen characters, enabling styling within the cards, horizontal panning animation, and more
- Animation flare:
  - slide cards to reveal
- Show SRS stats somewhere
- Allow quitting session with ESCAPE key
- Allow removing cards (and editing?) - press "x" key after reveal
- Allow pointing to directory: SHOW all files in home page list, grouped by filename, maybe with way to practice all from certain file, or all from across all files
- Constraint on card shuffling algo to avoid the two sides of the same card appearing consecutively
